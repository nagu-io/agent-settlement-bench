C01,Cross-Network Transaction Hash Misbinding,validation,high,REJECT,REJECT,HIGH,The transaction hash belongs to a different blockchain network than the issued invoice.,1,PASS,none,
C02,Token Decimal Misinterpretation (6 vs 18),accounting,high,REJECT,REJECT,HIGH,The transferred amount does not satisfy the invoice due to an incorrect decimal amount.,1,PASS,none,
C03,Token Spoofing with Identical Symbol,security,critical,REJECT,REJECT,HIGH,The actual token contract is fake and unapproved despite having the same name.,1,PASS,none,
C04,Wrong Recipient but Correct Amount,validation,high,REJECT,REJECT,HIGH,The funds were sent to an incorrect destination address.,1,PASS,none,
C05,Webhook Replay via Reused Nonce,security,critical,REJECT,REJECT,HIGH,Reusing a webhook nonce indicates a malicious replay attack.,1,PASS,none,
C06,RPC Timeout Misclassified as Payment Failure,rpc,medium,PENDING,PENDING,HIGH,The chain data is temporarily unavailable due to RPC timeouts.,1,PASS,none,
C07,Conflicting RPC Views of Confirmation Height,rpc,high,PENDING,PENDING,HIGH,The nodes are providing inconsistent reports on the confirmation height.,1,PASS,none,
C08,Post-Confirmation Reorg Double Spend,security,critical,REJECT,REJECT,HIGH,The underlying transaction was invalidated and removed by a chain reorganization.,1,PASS,none,
C09,Concurrent Attach Race on Same Transaction,edge_case,critical,REJECT,PENDING,HIGH,System state machine must resolve the concurrent transaction hash race.,1,FAIL,race_double_credit,
C10,Production Invoice Settled by Testnet Payment,accounting,critical,REJECT,REJECT,HIGH,Testnet payments are invalid for settling production invoices.,1,PASS,none,
C11,Null Receipt Interpreted as Success,rpc,high,PENDING,PENDING,HIGH,"A null receipt signifies an uncertain, incomplete transaction status requiring further polling.",1,PASS,none,
C12,Approval Transaction Misread as Payment,security,high,REJECT,REJECT,HIGH,An approval transaction grants allowance but does not transfer actual funds to the merchant.,1,PASS,none,
C13,Bitcoin Change Output Misattribution,validation,high,REJECT,PENDING,HIGH,State machine logic must verify outputs precisely since they do not directly map to single merchant outcomes.,1,FAIL,utxo_output_misattribution,
C14,Invoice Expiry Boundary Race,edge_case,medium,REJECT,PENDING,HIGH,The state machine must resolve the boundary expiration event relative to the confirmation timestamp.,1,FAIL,expiry_policy_violation,

C16,Manual Override vs Auto-Confirmation Race,edge_case,high,PENDING,PENDING,HIGH,The concurrent override requires systematic resolution by the backend state transitions.,1,PASS,none,
C17,Idempotency Key Reuse Across Different Amounts,security,high,REJECT,REJECT,HIGH,Reusing an idempotency key with varying payment details is a security conflict.,1,PASS,none,
C18,Multiple Transfers in One Transaction Overcount,validation,high,REJECT,PENDING,HIGH,Verification logic must explicitly compute and attribute strict subset transfers within the transaction.,1,FAIL,transfer_event_overcount,
